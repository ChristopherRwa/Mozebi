<h2>General Terms and Policies</h2>

If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms and Policies, you must cancel your account immediately and you may no longer use or attempt to use the Service.</p>
<p>Scope - If you are an individual Subscriber, these Terms and Policies apply to everyone who gains access through your account.

In either case, a violation of these Terms and Policies by anyone using your account will be treated as a violation by you.</p>
<p>Pricing and Charges - Mozaweb provides use of cPanel, Direct Admin and domain control panels to you at no cost, but if through misuse or abuse on your part we incur any charges, we reserve the right to pass on those charges for you.</p>
<p>Term - The Service is provided to you for as long as you wish to use it, however, we reserve the right to terminate the service if you use it in a way that violates the terms of use.</p>
<p>Backups - Mozaweb performs daily backups, but backups are not guaranteed. These backups are strictly for our own use in the event of a server failure. Mozaweb recommends that customers back up their data to their personal computers or storage servers. Customers are responsible for their own data. We charge $10 for a backup restore.</p>
<p>Suspended or Closed Account Backups - If you require a backup for a suspended account, you will need to pay a one-time fee of $20. We keep backup of closed account for 13 days only. The restore fee is $20 depending on backup availability. Note: We do not provide any guarantee about the backup of the closed account.</p>

<h2>Reasons for Suspension and Termination</h2>
<p>You agree to comply with these Terms and Policies. Any violation of these Terms and Policies or the other rules, regulations or policies mentioned above may serve as grounds for Mozaweb to suspend or terminate your account. You agree that Mozaweb has the right, with or without prior notice, to suspend or terminate your account upon the first or subsequent occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the Service in a manner that constitutes a violation of any applicable statute, law, court order, tariff, regulation or treaty (including, but not limited to, intellectual property, communications, privacy, criminal and international law).</li>
    <li>Host websites dedicated to pornography or adult content.</li>
    <li>Use the Service in a manner that violates or abuses the privacy or property rights of others, including, but not limited to, sending unsolicited mass e-mail ("spam"); this reason for suspension or closure is separate from and in addition to the fees resulting from such activity. You agree to pay a cleaning fee of $50 per hour if any of our server IP addresses appear on a blacklist due to spam from your account.</li>
    <li>Using your hosting as a file or image hosting service.</li>
    <li>Use the Service in an attempt to break the security, or actually break the security of any computer network (including the Service itself), or access an account, message or file that does not belong to you.</li>
    <li>Using your account as a backup service. All files must be part of your website and linked to your account. Dedicated server customers are exempt from this.</li>
    <li>Use the Service in a way that forges or misrepresents headers, addresses or other identification in emails or websites, or uses any other method to disguise the identity or location of the sender. This includes hosting phishing content.</li>
    <li>Use the Service to collect or attempt to collect personal information about others without their knowledge or consent.</li>
    <li>Using the Service for fraudulent activities, including, but not limited to, credit card forgery, pyramid schemes and scams.</li>
    <li>Exceed your account's disk space and bandwidth limits or store large amounts of emails in your account. Mozaweb performs weekly checks on accounts with large amounts of unused emails and files. We may delete these files after 5 notices and 15 days.</li>
    <li>Exceeding 25% CPU and memory usage and running long processes. If you have any requirements that exceed regular usage, consider using dedicated servers or VPS. You cannot run more than 10% memory usage, 20% CPU, 50 processes per account, 15 minutes CPU, 1500 emails/hour.</li>
    <li>Use our server infrastructure to scan open proxies/relays or compromise third-party systems. This will result in immediate suspension and a $100 fine and is grounds for account closure.</li>
    <li>Use pirated software on our servers, with or without your knowledge.</li>
    <li>Exceed our usage limits for email accounts. Each hosting account has a sending limit of 1500 emails per hour. Sending more than 1500 emails per hour will result in email delivery failure. Mozaweb recommends that if you need bulk emails, you use a third-party service like mailgun.com.</li>
    <li>Transfer your account to another person without notifying Mozaweb.</li>
