The Company disclaims, and you agree, that the Company is not liable for any inaccuracies regarding the registration information relating to (i) the input of the information by you; and (ii) the input of the information by the Registry Administrator. The Company will not be held liable, nor refund a domain name registration due to spelling errors/typos.

3. Multiple Domain Registrations

4. Fees

a. Payment of fees as a condition to domain registration. As consideration for the domain registration service provided by the Company, you agree to pay the Company, prior to the effectiveness of the desired domain registration, all registration and other applicable fees as indicated via the payment method selected at the time of registration. All fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then-current registration term. It is the responsibility of the listed registrant for the domain name to maintain records appropriate to document and prove the initial domain name registration date.

b. Reservation of right to modify fees. The Company reserves the right to modify fees, surcharges, and renewal fees or to institute new fees at any time with 30 days’ notice, for any reason, at its sole discretion.

c. Credit card charge-backs for domain registrations. In the event of a charge-back to the Company by the credit card company (or similar action by another payment provider used by us) for the credit card used in connection with the payment of the registration or other fee, you agree and acknowledge that the domain registration shall be transferred to the Company, as the paying entity for that registration to the registry(ies) and that we reserve all rights regarding such domain including, without limitation, the right to make the domain available to other parties for purchase. the Company also reserves the right to lock your account and the remainder of your domains until we receive your payment of any administrative fees and/or chargeback fees. In the Company’s sole discretion, we may reinstate your domain registration, subject to the Company’s receipt of the registration fee and any administrative and/or chargeback fees described above.

d. Credit card charge-backs for non-domain registration services. In the event of a charge-back by the credit card company (or similar action by another payment provider) for the credit card used in connection with the payment of a non-domain registration fee, you agree and acknowledge that service shall not initiate or will be discontinued, if previously in use, and any information maintained by the service may be deleted along with your account and the remainder of your services being locked until we receive your payment of any administrative fees and/or chargeback fees. In the Company’s sole discretion, we may reinstate your services, subject to the Company’s receipt of the non-domain registration fee and any administrative and/or chargeback fees described above.

Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that ICANN and the Registry Administrators may establish guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that the Company may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available. Further, you hereby consent to any and all such disclosures and use of, and guidelines, limits and restrictions on disclosure or use of, information provided by you in connection with the registration of a domain (including any updates to such information), whether during or after the term of your registration of the domain. Moreover, you hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action that may arise or have arose from such disclosure or use of your Registration Information and the Additional Registration Information.

d. Information updating and accuracy obligations. As a condition to continued registration of your domain, you must provide us with updated Registration Information within seven (7) days of any changes to such information. You may review, modify or update your Registration Information by accessing the Company’s domain manager service, domain management console or similar service, made available at our website. In accordance with ICANN policies, you acknowledge and agree that if you willfully provide inaccurate information or fail to update your Registration Information within seven (7) days of any change, then you will be in material breach of this Registration Agreement and we may in our sole discretion cancel your domain registration. You further agree that your failure to respond within ten (10) days to any inquiry by the Company concerning the accuracy of the Registration Information or to contact the Company immediately upon discovery of any willful inaccuracy (including, e.g., phone number listed as 000-0000) associated with your domain registration shall constitute a material breach of this Registration Agreement and will be sufficient basis for cancellation of your domain registration. You further represent that you have obtained consent from any third-party individuals whose personal data you have provided as Registration Information.

e. Information requirements for renewals. Upon renewal of your domain registration, the type of information you are required to provide may have changed. If you do not wish to provide the new required information, your domain registration may not be renewed.

f. Ownership of data. You agree and acknowledge that the Company owns all database, compilation, collective and similar rights, title and interests worldwide in our domain database (“Domain Database”), and all information and derivative works generated from such Domain Database, which contains Registration Information and Additional Registration Information. You further agree and acknowledge that the Company may use the following information for those domain registrations for which we are the registrar: (a) the original creation date of the registration; (b) the expiration date of the registration; (c) the name, postal address, email address, voice telephone number, and where available fax number of the technical contact, authorized contact, zone contact and billing contact for the domain registration; (d) any remarks concerning the registered domain that appear or should appear in the WHOIS or similar database; and (e) any other information the Company generates or obtains in connection with the provision of domain registration services, other than the domain being registered, the Internet protocol (IP) addresses of the primary nameserver and any secondary nameservers for the domain, and the corresponding names of those nameservers. The Company does not have any ownership interest in your specific personal registration information outside of its rights in its Domain Database.

g. Registrant Verification. You understand and agree that Registrar is required to verify the Registered Name Holder’s email address within 15 days of any registration, transfer, or change to the Registered Name Holder’s contact information. The Domain Name Holder’s failure to verify the contact information within 15 days constitutes a material breach of this Registration Agreement and will result in the immediate suspension of the domain name(s) and associated service(s).

In addition, you understand and agree that Registrar is required to verify any changes to any WHOIS contact information within 15 days of any change. The Domain Name Holder’s failure to verify such changes within 15 days constitutes a material breach of this Registration Agreement and will result in the immediate suspension of the domain name(s) and associated service(s).

6. Domain Privacy Service

a. If you purchased domain privacy services (“Domain Privacy”), you agree that your Registration Information will be replaced in any public WHOIS search with information provided by the Company as determined in its sole discretion (the “Private WHOIS Contact Information”).

b. Although the Private WHOIS Contact Information will appear in any public WHOIS search result, you are solely responsible for resolving any and all monetary, creditor, or other claims that arise in connection with a legal or other dispute involving your domain name registration. Use of the Domain Privacy service in no way alleviates your obligation to provide valid and accurate Registration Information and to update and correct such information pursuant to the terms of this Registration Agreement.

c. The Domain Privacy service is NOT a general mail forwarding service. You agree that you will not provide any third party with the Private WHOIS Contact Information for the purpose of having such third party transmit communications to you. The Company may immediately terminate the Domain Privacy service and, at its sole option, disclose the Registration Information in the event that you breach this Agreement.

d. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you agree that the Company may, but is not obligated to, review and forward communications in connection with your domain name that it receives. You hereby authorize the Company to receive, sort, open, forward, and destroy any and all mail sent to our address at our sole discretion. You specifically acknowledge that the Company is not obligated but may forward to you certified or traceable courier mail (such as UPS or Federal Express deliveries), legal notices, or first class U.S. postal mail; however, the Company will NOT forward “junk” mail or other unsolicited communications (whether delivered through fax, postal mail, or telephone), and you further authorize the Company to either discard all such communications or return all such communications to the sender. You agree that: (i) postal mail may be forwarded via regular mail forwarding or scanned and emailed electronically to the email address listed in the Registration Information; (ii) emails will be forwarded to the email address listed in the Registration Information; and (iii) callers will be directed to use the mailing or email address listed on the Private WHOIS Contact Information and we will forward such mail or email pursuant to the terms of this section; we will not relay phone messages to you. You agree to waive any and all claims arising from your failure to receive communications directed to your domain name but not forwarded or referred to you by the Company.

e. If any domain name for which you are using the Domain Privacy service is transferred to another registrar, Domain Privacy will automatically cease and no refund will be given for any unused portion of the service.

f. Failure to renew the Domain Privacy service while your domain name registration is still valid will result in the Domain Privacy being suspended, terminated or cancelled and your Registration Information will be displayed in any public WHOIS search. Domain Privacy renewals after initial purchase will be at the standard list price, which is available by logging in to your account.

g. The Company expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without any liability to you whatsoever, to suspend or cancel your use of the Service and/or reveal the Registration Information in any public WHOIS search or to any third party at any time without notice to you:

* To comply with any applicable laws, rules, regulations or requirements, or with any subpoenas, court orders, official government inquiries or requests of law enforcement;
* To comply with ICANN’s Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp);
* To resolve any and all third-party claims, whether threatened or made, arising out of your use of the Domain Privacy service, including without limitation, to avoid a dispute of any claim that the registered domain name violates or infringes a third party’s trademark, trade name, or other legal rights;
* In the event you breach any provision of this Registration Agreement or any other agreement you’ve entered into with the Company, including, but not limited to, the Terms of Service;
* To comply with the rules, procedures, or practices of the registry that governs the domain name extension receiving the Domain Privacy service and to protect the integrity and stability of the applicable domain name registry;
* To avoid any financial loss or legal liability (civil or criminal) on the part of the Company, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, shareholders, agents, officers, directors, or employees;
* To prevent inappropriate activity that comes to the Company’s attention, including without limitation if you are using Domain Privacy to hide your involvement in illegal or morally objectionable activities, including without limitation, activities that are intended to or otherwise: (i) appeal purely to the prurient interests of third parties; (ii) defame, embarrass, harm, abuse, threaten, or harass third parties; (iii) violate state or federal laws of the United States and/or foreign territories; (iv) involve hate crimes, terrorism, or child pornography; (v) are tortious, vulgar, obscene, invasive of a third party’s privacy, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) impersonate the identity of a third party; (vii) harm minors in any way; or (viii) relate to or transmit viruses, Trojan Horses, access codes, backdoors, worms, time bombs, or any other code, routine, mechanism, device or item that corrupts, damages, impairs, interferes with, intercepts or misappropriates any software, hardware, firmware, network, system, data, or personally identifiable information.

h. Pursuant to paragraph 3.7.7.3 (http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/raa/approved-with-specs-27jun13-en.htm#raa) of ICANN’s Registrar Accreditation Agreement (“RAA”), you agree that if you license use of a Registered Name (as that term is defined in the RAA) to a third party, you are nonetheless the Registered Name Holder of record (as that term is defined in the RAA) and are responsible for providing the full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical and administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the Registered Name. A Registered Name Holder licensing use of a Registered Name according to this provision shall accept liability for any harm caused by wrongful use of the Registered Name, unless the Registered Name Holder discloses the current contact information provided by the licensee and the identity of the licensee within seven (7) days to a party that provides the Registered Name Holder reasonable evidence of actionable harm.

7. Domain Parking

a. Upon registration, the domain will be automatically placed on name servers provided by the Company, and Internet users that type in the domain will be redirected to a “coming soon” page (collectively, “parking a domain” or a “parked domain”). There is no charge for parking a domain. You hereby consent to and authorize the Company’s placement of a “coming soon” page, and its associated contents, on your parked domain. You may change the name server configuration (or “un-park” the domain) after the registration is complete. If you need to register name servers using the domains that you are currently registering, the names will initially be parked with the Company until you modify the name servers after the domain registration is complete, using your account manager.

b. In the event your domain registration expires, your registration is no longer valid. If you are able to renew the domain name, you may update the domain to its original settings. After expiration, but prior to renewal, the domain may be pointed to an “expired” page (collectively, “parking a domain” or a “parked domain”). There is no charge for the parked domain. By not renewing the domain, the Company may place an “expired” page, and its associated contents, on the parked domain. You may change the name server configuration (or “un-park” the domain) after the renewal is complete. If you need to register name servers using the domains that you are currently renewing, the names will initially be parked with the Company until you modify the name servers after the domain renewal is complete, using your account manager.

c. The “coming soon” and/or “expired” pages may contain advertisements and other materials selected by the Company, in the Company’s sole discretion. This may include, but is not limited to third-party websites, third-party product and service offerings, and/or Internet search engines. The Company reserves the right to collect and retain all revenue obtained from such advertising and other materials.

d. DNS Wildcard. In the event you utilize the Company’s DNS management services and fail to configure a wildcard DNS for your domain, the Company may insert wildcard DNS records to resolve subdomains of your domain that would not otherwise resolve. The Company may point those subdomains to a web page that may contain advertisements and other materials selected by the Company in the Company’s sole discretion. This may include, but is not limited to, third-party websites, third-party product and service offerings, and/or Internet search engines.

8. Registration Renewal

a. Renewal obligations. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any and all domains and additional services are renewed prior to their expiration, should you so desire their renewal. You may renew your domain at any time before the expiration date. the Company shall have no liability to you or any third party in connection with the renewal, including, but not limited to, any failure or errors in renewing the services.

b. You may be notified at the Company’s sole discretion when renewal fees are due. Should these fees go unpaid within the time specified in a notice or reminder regarding renewal, your registration will be cancelled. Payment must be made by such other method as we indicate in the renewal form. If your billing information is not accurate, you are solely responsible for the failure to renew.

c. Autorenewal. You agree that if you paid for any services provided hereunder by credit card or other payment service (such as PayPal), you hereby authorize but do NOT obligate, the Company to automatically charge your credit card or payment service account and renew the applicable service(s) on or before their renewal date using the credit card or other acceptable payment information you have provided to the Company, unless you notify the Company that you do not wish to participate in the Company’s automatic renewal process. The Company must receive notification of your intent to not renew (opt-out) no later than sixteen (16) days prior to the renewal date. In the absence of such notification from you, the Company will automatically renew, for a period of one (1) or two (2) years, as set forth by the applicable registry depending on the TLD or ccTLD of your domain name, any domain that is up for renewal and will charge the credit card or payment service account you have on file with the Company, at the Company’s then current rates. You are solely responsible for the credit card or other payment information you provide to the Company and must promptly inform the Company of any changes thereto (e.g., change of expiration date or account number). If the credit card or payment service account has expired or is otherwise invalid, you are solely responsible for a failure to renew and the Company shall not be liable for your failure.

d. Expired domain names. You agree that we may place our contact information in the WHOIS output for any expired domain name, as the failure to renew results in the immediate cancellation of registration and loss of all rights to the domain name. Should you choose not to renew your domain name, you agree that we may, in our sole discretion, renew and transfer the domain name to a third party on your behalf as an Expired Domain Transfer (“ED Transfer”).

e. New customers through domain auction or brokerage partners and/or ED Transfers. If you are registering a domain name that was registered with, and not yet deleted by, the Company at the time of your purchase, you acknowledge and agree that the term of your registration will be for a period of one year from the original expiration date for the domain name immediately prior to your purchase, as the registration is the result of an ED Transfer (defined above). You will not be compensated for the inability to use the domain from the time it was expired until the time you are able to use the domain in your account. NOTE: You may not transfer your domain name to another Registrar for sixty (60) days from the date of any previous transfer.

9. Domain Dispute Resolution Policy

You agree to be bound by the appropriate domain dispute resolution policy (“Dispute Policy”) applicable to the domain that you have selected, including the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, which can be found here. The Dispute Policy has been developed by ICANN and/or the specific Registration Administrator(s) and is incorporated by reference in this Registration Agreement. Certain disputes are subject to the applicable Dispute Policy. In the event such dispute arises, you agree that you will be subject to the provisions specified in the applicable Dispute Policy in effect at the time your domain registration is disputed by a third party. You further agree that, in the event a domain dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold the Company harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable Dispute Policy. The Dispute Policy may be modified at any time by ICANN or the applicable Registry Administrator, and your continued use of the domain registered to you after any such Dispute Policy modification shall constitute your acceptance of the modified Dispute Policy and this Registration Agreement. If you do not agree to any of such changes, you may request that your domain registration be cancelled or transferred to a different domain registrar. For the adjudication of disputes concerning or arising from use of the second level domain (“SLD”) name, the SLD holder shall submit, without prejudice to other potentially applicable jurisdictions, to the jurisdiction of the courts (1) of the SLD holder’s domicile and (2) where registrar is located. In addition, you agree to the rules of ICANN’s Uniform Rapid Suspension (“URS”) (http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/applicants/urs) and to submit to any proceedings commenced pursuant to the URS, if applicable.

10. Change of Registrant Of Domains

a. Change of Registrant. Effective December 1, 2016, for all gTLDs, any material changes to a domain name registrant’s name, company, email address, or to the administrative contact email address (if there is no registrant email address) are subject to ICANN’s Transfer Policy (available at https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en).

b. We are required to deny a change of registrant for any of the following reasons:

* the domain name registration agreement has expired and the registrant no longer has the right to renew the domain name or to transfer the domain name to another registrar;
* the change of registrant was not properly authorized by the Prior Registrant and the New Registrant; or
* the domain name is subject to a domain name dispute proceeding, including, but not limited to, the following:
- Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) (https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/help/dndr/udrp-en);
- Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS) (https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/urs-2014-01-09-en);
- Registrar Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy (https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tdrp-2012-02-25-en);or
- a court order.
* Unless a change of registrant is otherwise prohibited, the Prior Registrant and the New Registrant, or their Designated Agents, must confirm the change of registrant within 60 days of the request.
* Unless you opt out of the transfer lock when you request a change of registrant, you may not transfer your domain registration to another domain registrar for sixty (60) days following the change of registrant.

c. Designated Agent. You hereby explicitly authorize us to act as “Designated Agent” to approve a change of registrant on behalf of the Prior Registrant and the New Registrant, consistent with and pursuant to the requirements of ICANN’s Transfer Policy.

d. Transfer of registration to another registrant. The entity or person named as the “registrant” at the time the controlling user name and password are secured shall be the registrant of the domain. You agree that prior to the effectiveness of any transfer of ownership of your domain to another entity, the Company reserves the right to enforce any amount published for the transfer of ownership of a domain. You further agree that, as a condition of any such transfer of ownership of the domain, the party to which you seek to transfer your domain shall agree in writing (electronic acceptance is acceptable) to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Registration Agreement. Your domain will not be transferred until we receive such written assurances (or reasonable assurance as determined by the Company in its sole discretion) and actual payment of the transfer fee, if any is imposed. You acknowledge and agree that if you attempt to transfer your domain registration without paying the Company the amount published for the transfer of ownership of a domain, or if the entity to which you seek to transfer your domain fails to agree in writing to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Registration Agreement, any such transfer will be null and void, and will result in your domain registration being revoked without a refund of any charges you have incurred in attempting to register or transfer that domain.

e.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.

c. Arbitration. Your use of the Services is also governed by the following:

* Informal Process First. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Purple IT Ltd, you will first contact us and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to arbitration under these Terms.

* Binding Arbitration. Any dispute or claim that remains unresolved after the informal dispute resolution described in Section 1 except for disputes relating to the infringement of our intellectual property rights or the access or use of the Service in violation of these Terms (a “Claim”) or Claims seeking more than $10,000 in damages, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, provided that you may assert Claims in small claims court located in Suffolk County, Massachusetts if your Claims qualify

* No Judge or Jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would

* Arbitrator and Rules. The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer Related Disputes. These rules can be found on the AAA website at www.adr.org. In the event of a conflict between the commercial arbitration rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this agreement shall control, and the parties shall designate another arbitrator.

* Starting an Arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send written notice to Purple IT Ltd’s Legal Department of its intent to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to Purple IT Ltd should be sent by any of the following means:(i) electronic mail; or (ii) sending the Notice by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to Purple IT Ltd.

The Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (y) set forth the specific relief sought. If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Purple IT Ltd may commence an arbitration proceeding.

* Format of Proceedings. The arbitration will be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions.

* Fees. If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, we will pay all other AAA and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. Any fees greater than the filing fees of the small claims court in your home jurisdiction will be paid by Purple IT Ltd.

* Individual Basis; Jury Trial Waiver. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Purple IT Ltd each agree that any proceeding to resolve a Claim will be conducted only in the respective party’s individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, multiple plaintiff or representative action (“Class Action”). If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Purple IT Ltd each waive any right to a jury trial. You and Purple IT Ltd expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.

* Enforcement. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will have no applicability.

* Invalidity. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and Purple IT Ltd each agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in Boston, Massachusetts, and you and Purple IT Ltd each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any applicable dispute or claim.

* Opting Out. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with us and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@Purple IT Ltd-inc.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Service.

* Confidentiality. The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

d. Notices. You agree that any notices required to be given under this Registration Agreement by the Company to you will be deemed to have been given if delivered in accordance with the contact information you have provided.

e. Relationship. The Company and you are independent contractors and nothing contained in this Registration Agreement places the Company and you in the relationship of principal and agent, partners or joint venturers. Neither party has, expressly or by implication, or may represent itself as having, any authority to make contracts or enter into any agreements in the name of the other party, or to obligate or bind the other party in any manner whatsoever.

f. Waiver. No failure or delay by any party hereto to exercise any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy by any party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. No express waiver or assent by any party hereto to any breach of or default in any term or condition of this Registration Agreement shall constitute a waiver of or an assent to any succeeding breach of or default in the same or any other term or condition hereof.

If the Order is a .NAME Defensive Registration, the Registrant, must also agree to the following terms:

1. DEFENSIVE REGISTRATIONS

Defensive Registrations allow owners of nationally registered marks to exclusively pre-register on the .NAME space and create a protective barrier for their trademarks. A "Defensive Registration" is a registration granted to a third party of a specific string on the second or third level, or of a specific set of strings on the second and third levels, which will not resolve within the domain name system but may prevent the registration of the same string(s) on the same level(s) by other third party applicants.

2. PHASES OF DEFENSIVE REGISTRATIONS

(1) As a Defensive Registration Registrant ("Defensive Registrant"), you hereby certify to the best of your knowledge that for Phase I Defensive Registrations ("Phase I Defensive Registrants"), you own valid and enforceable trademark or service mark registrations having national effect that issued prior to April 16, 2001 for strings that are identical to the textual or word elements, using ASCII characters only, subject to the same character and formatting restrictions as apply to all registrations in the Registry TLD. You understand that trademark or service mark registrations from the supplemental or equivalent Registry of any country, or from individual states or provinces of a nation, will not be accepted. Subject to the same character and formatting restrictions as apply to all registrations in the Registry TLD, if a trademark or service mark registration incorporates design elements, the ASCII character portion of that mark may qualify to be a Phase I Defensive Registration.

(2) Phase II Defensive Registrants may apply for a Defensive Registration for any string or combination of strings.

(3) Defensive Registrants, whether Phase I or Phase II shall comply with the following Eligibility Requirements, available at http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/name/registry-agmt-appl-03jul01.htm, the summary of which is as follows:

(1) There are two levels of Defensive Registrations, each of which is subject to payment of a separate fee;

(2) Multiple persons or entities may obtain identical or overlapping Defensive Registrations upon payment by each of a separate registration fee;

You must provide contact information, including name, email address, postal address and telephone number, for use in disputes relating to the Defensive Registration. You understand and agree that this contact information will be provided as part of the Whois record for the Defensive Registration. You further understand that the foregoing registration data may be transferred outside of the European Community, such as to the United States, and you expressly consent to such export.

In addition to the information provided in subsection 1. above, Phase I Defensive Registrants must also provide:

(1) the name, in ASCII characters, of the trademark or service mark being registered;

(2) the date the registration issued;

(3) the country of registration; and

(4) the registration number or other comparable identifier used by the registration authority.

4. DISPUTE POLICY

If you registered a Defensive Registration, you agree that:

(1) the Defensive Registration will be subject to challenge pursuant to the Eligibility Requirements Dispute Resolution Policy ("ERDRP");

(2) if the Defensive Registration is successfully challenged pursuant to the ERDRP, the Defensive Registrant will pay the challenge fees; and

(3) if a challenge is successful, then the Defensive Registration will be subject to the procedures described in Section 2(h) of Appendix F to the agreement of Global Name Registry ("Registry Operator") with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), available at http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/name/registry-agmt-appl-03jul01.htm;

(4) if a Phase I Defensive Registration is successfully challenged on the basis that it did not meet the applicable Eligibility Requirements, the Defensive Registrant will thereafter be required to demonstrate, at its expense, that it meets the Eligibility Requirements for Phase I Defensive Registrations for all other Phase I Defensive Registrations that it registered within .NAME through any Registrar. In the event that the Defensive Registrant is unable to demonstrate the foregoing with respect to any such Phase I Defensive Registration(s), those Defensive Registration(s) will be cancelled;

(5) The ERDRP applies to, among other things, challenges to Defensive Registrations within .NAME and is available at http://www.icann.org/tlds/agreements/name/registry-agmt-appm-03jul01.htm.

5. CONSENT

Defensive Registrants may be asked to give their consent to allow individuals to share a part of their space. For example, if you have filed a Defensive Registration on PQR (which blocks out ANYSTRING.PQR.name and PQR.ANYSTRING.name), you may be asked to give consent to John Pqr to register JOHN.PQR.name if he can prove that PQR is his name. In such a circumstance, you will have five (5) days to respond to a request for consent.
